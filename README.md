# Experiments

This repository is for bits of code that don't really fit anywhere
else.  Some are the result of learning-by-doing with new features and
libraries, while others are more purposeful puzzles or challenges.

In some cases I've come back to these files and found them useful
later, when trying to remember how a particular feature (like XML
parsing or writing, or SQLite DB access) works.

Many of the files were written for Python 2.x and haven't been updated
for Python 3 (and are unlikely to be in the near future); others
aren't in a working state at all, for various reasons.

Use at your own risk for whatever purpose you may find useful.
