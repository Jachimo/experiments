AppleDouble "Flags" to Finder "Labels" Reference
================================================

Finder "Labels" (colored, with customizable names per color)
seem to be stored as "Flags" in the AppleDouble file.

Flag values are numeric, while colors are ... colors.

    00 02    02    Gray
    00 02    02    Gray + Yellow
    00 04    04    Green + Red
    00 0A    10    Yellow
    00 0C    12    Red
    00 0C    12    Orange + Red
    00 0E    14    Orange

Seems like multiple Labels on the Finder side may result in only
one being preserved on the SMB share.  How it chooses to save
one or the other isn't obvious,
